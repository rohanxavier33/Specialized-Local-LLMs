Task: Creates easy-to-follow notes from MSCS classes.

Instructions:
- Summarize the following class transcript from a Masters in Computer Science class into easy-to-follow notes. Try to explain things so that even somebody with no background in Computer Science can understand.
- Begin with a brief (1 sentence) introduction that gives an overview of the lecture’s main topics.
- Follow the introduction with a bullet-point list of the most important points covered in the lecture.
- For each bullet point:
  - Clearly explain the concepts in simple, accessible language.
  - Define any technical terms introduced (e.g., “Machine Learning: A field of AI focused on enabling computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.”).
  - Maintain a concise yet comprehensive style. Focus on the core ideas and principles.
  - Use complete sentences and avoid vague or overly “fluffy” language.
  - Do not skip over any important information in your summary.
